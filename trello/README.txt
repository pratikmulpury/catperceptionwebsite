Started on february 27th. Worked approximately 30 hours on this project. 

There are no borrowed assets currently on the website other than the example firebase code. My main concern is the multipage design as opposed to a single page.

Used code from example_Firebase and looked at the vue js tutorial and firebase guide. Uses styles.css, the javascript files in the javascript folder except for trello.js, and login.html, signup.html, projectmanager.html, and change.html. There is a sample json file but the project is fully integrated with firebase. The three challenging feature implemented are making any number of comments on a card, assigning any number of users to  a card, and viewing the changes to any card and when the changes were made on the changes page.
