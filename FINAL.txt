Our project is focused on exploring human categorical perception with a specific concentration on color. Humans and many animals are known to interpret and perceive  their surroundings though a limited, categorically structured, and often culturally developed lense rather than the natural color spectrum they more accurately exist in. Research of this subject requires large sample sizes from an abundance of regions and demographics. In collaboration with Duke researchers working on this topic we hope to contribute to this field. Our aim is to create a website thats acts as tool to test thousands of people efficiently and effectively. The website will record and store data from tests administered on the website to thousands of users (the website will also store data from experiments that were already conducted by the lab), as well as offer an adaptable experimental setup and easy to use front end. Additionally, we hope to provide statistics and charts that can be used to extract meaning from the data we collect.
