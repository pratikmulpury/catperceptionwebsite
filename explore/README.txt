Used angular-cli and angular-cli-ghpages. Referred to angular.io for the tutorial and also the angular cli readme on GitHub. Also looked at angular-cli-ghpages readme on npm

There are multiple code files used in my website all created by me when I generated them using a development server. The image called “clock.png” is labeled for reuse with modification and has a Creative Commons media license. Have a working copy on my local machine. When deploying I ran into some bugs with loading clock.png so I adjusted the js files in the dist folder.
