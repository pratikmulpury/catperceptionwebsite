        <h2>Computer Science Autobiography</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I first started using a computer in 2006</li>
            <li>I have used a windows desktop and various macbooks</li>
            <li>I use it for classwork, programming, gaming, listening to music, and communication</li>
            <li>I think computer scientists daily work on implementing features in projects or debugging </li>
            <li>After going to a hackathon and later coming up with ideas for some interesting projects I thought the skills taught in this course would be useful </li>
            <li>Skills such as server side development (sql etc..), front end development (javascript, are necessary,and experience with different apis are necessary</li>
            <li>I see myself continuing to use computers the same way I've used them thus far</li>
        </ul>
