        <h2> Computer Science Autobiography</h2>
        <p>
            I first started using computers in 2007, when I was 8 years old. My first computer was a Windows desktop. Soon after, my I started using an iMac. Besides classwork, I used my computers for programming,  gaming, listening to music and communication. As a Computer Scientist I would like to design and develop software that makes a difference in our lives. After participating in a hackathon and later coming up with ideas for some interesting projects, I thought the skills taught in this course would be useful for creating elegant, simple and impressionable products. I feel knowledge of server side development (database, web services, sql etc.) front end development (javascript, html, css) and software engineering skills are necessary to build great web products. Computers will become much more ubiquitous going forward and I see myself using them the same way I've always had except maybe that will change through brain machine interfaces in the future.
