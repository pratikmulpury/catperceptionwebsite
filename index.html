        <h2 > Computer Science Autobiography</h2>
        <p>
            I first started using computers in 2007, when I was 8 years old. My first computer was a Windows desktop. Soon after, my I started using an iMac. Besides classwork, I used my computers for programming,  gaming, listening to music and communication. As a Computer Scientist I would like to design and develop software that makes a difference in our lives. After participating in a hackathon and later coming up with ideas for some interesting projects, I thought the skills taught in this course would be useful for creating elegant, simple and impressionable products. I feel knowledge of server side development (database, web services, sql etc.) front end development (javascript, html, css) and software engineering skills are necessary to build great web products. Computers will become much more ubiquitous going forward and I see myself using them the same way I've always had except maybe that will change through brain machine interfaces in the future.

            <li>I love <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a>  It has a simple and appealing design that  makes it easy both to find the music you are looking for and also to discover new music. </li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> is very cluttered with too many things going on the same time.</li>
            <li> Building the website for my nonprofit<a href="http://www.yellowpomelo.org/">Yellow Pomelo</a> was an awesome experience. Although, I didn't do it progammatically, I still learned a bit about web design building it. Hopefully,after this class I can improve the design.</li>
